This plugin gives you a WPAI helper class that generates functions for you using OpenAI.

== DISCLAIMER ==

DO NOT USE THIS PLUGIN!!!

But if you do:

You run this code ENTIRELY AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!

You accept ALL responsibility for anything that might happen as a result of using this plugin or running this code, including:
 - your website being broken beyond repair;
 - your laptop or server being wiped of all files;
 - your data being deleted from a database;
 - your passwords being posted to the internet;
 - your cup of tea being too cold;
 - your children being born with three heads;
 - all future Thursdays being cancelled;
 - or ANYTHING that might happen as a result of you using this code.

This code tells an AI of dubious trustworthiness to generate more code and then runs the more code on your computer.

You should not do this.

And if you DO do it, do it on a temporary VPS, or a walled-off temporary site, or an instawp.com site or something. And you do that - and I can't say this strongly enough - entirely at your own risk.

== Description ==

This plugin gives you a WPAI helper class that generates functions for you using OpenAI.

This is a toy/experiment and should not be used on a real website.

You will need an OpenAI account and API key. See the installation instructions below for how to get started.

One set up, you can use the WPAI helper class to generate functions for you. For example:

`WPAI::add_is_awesome_to_all_these_strings( strings: ['WordPress', 'Ross', 'AI'] );`

Notes on using this:

* You do not need to write this function. It is generated for you by the AI.
* The generated function MAY NOT BE CORRECT! It is generated by an AI, after all.
* The function name should be as descriptive as possible. Though the AI is pretty good at working out what you need.
* The function name should be snake_case_with_words_separated_by_underscores.
* You can pass as many arguments as you like. The AI will try to work out what to do with them.
* [Named arguments](https://www.php.net/manual/en/functions.arguments.php#functions.named-arguments) (PHP 8.0+) are recommended as they will make the generated code more readable.

When you do this:

* The plugin will create a description of what you want using the function name that you provide and the arguments that you pass.
* The plugin will send this description to the OpenAI API.
* OpenAI will generate a function for you.
* The plugin will save this function to a file in `mu-plugins/` for future use. Calling the same function will not require further API calls!
* The plugin will run the function with the arguments you have passed and return the result.

== Screenshots ==

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
